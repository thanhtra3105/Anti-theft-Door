# Anti-theft Door System

## Overview
This project implements a basic **anti-theft door protection system** designed to detect and prevent unauthorized access.  
The system integrates **microcontroller logic and sensor inputs** to monitor door status and trigger alerts when a security breach is detected.

---

## Features
- Detect unauthorized door opening
- Bridge hardware and firmware for real-time detection
- Simple visual schematics for hardware reference

---

## Hardware Design
The hardware components include door sensor interfaces and microcontroller connections.  
Hardware schematics and electrical design diagrams are included in the repository.

---

## Diagrams
Below are the key design diagrams for the system:
